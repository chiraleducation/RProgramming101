# Overview

Statistical analysis is an essential tool for public health professionals. R is a statistical programming language that allows us to analyze data quickly and easily. R is open-source software for Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and Unix platforms. You can use R to retrieve data from datasets, clean them, analyze and visualize them, and present them most suitably. Our LIVE course will guide you to learn R programming one step at a time.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the course, students should be comfortable:

-   Reading data into R
-   Recoding and manipulating data
-   Using R add-on packages
-   Making exploratory plots
-   Performing basic statistical tests
-   Understanding basic programming syntax
-   Creating reproducible R documents

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you make summary tables in R (data, survey data, regression models, time-to-event data, adverse event reports)?

-   Do you want your workflow to be reproducible?

-   Are you often frustrated with the immense amount of code required to create great-looking tables in R?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. It will be expected that you can perform basic data manipulation. Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R**

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Most recent release of the [**gtsummary**](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) and other packages used in workshop.

    ``` r
    instll_pkgs <- 
      c("gtsummary", "tidyverse", "labelled", "usethis", 
        "causaldata", "fs", "skimr", "car", "emmeans")
    install.packages(instll_pkgs)
    ```

-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

    -   Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    -   Save the document and check you are able to knit it.
