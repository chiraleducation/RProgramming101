It is difficult to decide which policy to accept orreject.\nSolution: By using the continuous credit report as input, we can create a model in R that will not only assess risk appetite but also make a predictive forecast as well.\n\n\n\nBanking\n\nProblem: Large amount of customer data is generated every day in Banks. While dealing with millions of customers on regular basis, it becomes hard to track their mortgages.\nSolution: R builds a custom model that maintains the loans provided to every individual customer which helps us to decide the amount to be paid by the customer over time."

Procedural programming includes procedure, records, modules, and procedure calls. While object-oriented programming languageincludes class, objects, and functions.\nPackages are part of R programming. Hence, they are useful in collecting sets of R functions into a single unit.\nR is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\nR has an effective data handling and storage facility,\nR provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.\nR provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis. It provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.\nRs programming features include database input, exporting data, viewing data, variable labels, missing data, etc.\nR is an interpreted language. So we can access it through command line interpreter.\nR supports matrix arithmetic.\nR, SAS, and SPSS are three statistical languages. Of these three statistical languages, R is the only an open source."

Easier to use for standard applications, but if there‚Äôs not a Stata command for what you want to do, it‚Äôs harder to write something yourself.\n\nStata is also very different than R in that you can only ever work with one dataset at a time, while in R, it‚Äôs typical to have a number of data objects in the environment.\n\nSAS: Similar to Stata, but more commonly used in business & the private sector, in part because it‚Äôs typically more convenient for massive datasets. Otherwise, I think it‚Äôs seen as a bit older and less user-friendly.\nPython: Another option based more on programming from scratch and with less prewritten commands. Python isn‚Äôt specific to math & statistics, but instead is a general programming language used across a range of fields.\nProbably the most similar software choice to R at this point, with better general use (and programming ease) at the cost of less package development specific to econometrics/data analysis.\nMatlab: Popular in macroeconomics and theory work, not so much in empirical work. Matlab is powerful, but is much more based on programming ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù using matrices and mathematical expressions."

See more details here, under the statistic argument section: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_summary.html\n\n\nQ: How do you display mean instead of median?\n\n\nAdjust the statistic argument:\n\n\ntrial %>%\n  select(age) %>%\n  tbl_summary(statistic = everything() ~ \"{mean}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 2001\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n47\n    Unknown\n11\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Mean\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: With add_n() can you change the label to specify that it represents non-missing values?\n\n\nYes, you can change this with col_label argument:\n\n\ntrial |>\n  select(age, grade, trt) %>%\n  tbl_summary(\n    by = trt,\n    missing = \"no\"\n  ) |> \n  add_overall() |> \n  add_n(col_label = \"**N (Non-missing)**\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N (Non-missing)\n      Overall, N = 2001\n      Drug A, N = 981\n      Drug B, N = 1021\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n189\n47 (38, 57)\n46 (37, 59)\n48 (39, 56)\n    Grade\n200\n\n\n\n    I\n\n68 (34%)\n35 (36%)\n33 (32%)\n    II\n\n68 (34%)\n32 (33%)\n36 (35%)\n    III\n\n64 (32%)\n31 (32%)\n33 (32%)\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How can you remove the death variable inside the tbl_summary() function?\n\n\nUse adplyr::select() prior to tbl_summary or use the include = argument in tbl_summary().

Or use modify_table_styling() for new footnotes. https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/modify_table_styling.html\n\n\nQ: Does gtsummary support role selection like {recipes}?\n\n\nUse the selectors all_continuous(), all_categorical(), etc.\n\n\nQ: There is an error trying to use add_difference() with add_p()\n\n\nThis is because you are trying to add two p‚Äôs to same table. You could consider doing two separate tables then using tbl_merge() to merge them, but presenting these two p-values in one table could be confusing.\n\n\nQ: It would be great to have an ‚Äúasterisk_p‚Äù to show significant p-values, like bold_p()\n\n\nadd_significance_stars() already exists! https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_significance_stars.html\n\n\nQ: If there are more than two groups, is there any function for post-hoc testing?\n\n\nHere are supported tests: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tests.html. Post-hoc tests might require custom testing. There are some relevant questions on stackoverflow.com that may be useful.\n\n\nQ: Can gtsummary give Bayesian statistics result?\n\n\nSee https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tests.html for supported tests. If it is not supported, you can use custom functions for p-values (see add_p()) or add_stat() to use a custom statistic.\n\n\nQ: The {rms} package fits are not supported?\n\n\nYou can file an issue for support. You can also use custom tidier. See Wald example in table gallery for tips on how to do this: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html#wald-ci\n\n\nQ: How does it handle interaction terms?\n\n\nGorgeously:\n\n\ntbl <-\n      lm(time ~ ph.ecog*sex, survival::lung) %>%\n      tbl_regression(label = list(ph.ecog = \"ECOG Score\", sex = \"Sex\"))\n    \ntbl\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    ECOG Score\n-119\n-233, -5.5\n0.040\n    Sex\n11\n-79, 102\n0.8\n    ECOG Score * Sex\n43\n-33, 120\n0.3\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What does exponentiate=TRUE do again in tbl_regression()? I missed it.\n\n\nExponentiation coefficients so you can easily report OR instead of log(OR) or HRs instead of raw coefficients.\n\n\nQ: Is there a way to add an additional footnote saying T1 is the control? The default dash may be interpreted as a ‚Äúmissing value‚Äù.\n\n\nmodify_table_styling() https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/modify_table_styling.html or use argument add_estimate_to_reference_rows = TRUE\n\n\nglm(death ~ age + grade, data = trial, family = binomial) %>%\n  tbl_regression( exponentiate = TRUE, add_estimate_to_reference_rows = FALSE ) %>%\n  add_global_p() %>%\n  modify_table_styling(columns = c(estimate, ci),\n                       rows = reference_row == TRUE, \n                       missing_symbol = \"Ref.\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      OR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n1.01\n0.99, 1.03\n0.3\n    Grade\n\n\n0.053\n    I\nRef.\nRef.\n\n    II\n1.11\n0.56, 2.24\n\n    III\n2.28\n1.11, 4.75\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use themes and change tbl_regression-str:ref_row_text option: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/themes.html\n\n\nQ: Can add_global_p() and the global p-value without removing the p-value for each level?\n\n\nThere is an arg in add_global_p() called keep; that will keep both p-values.

You can change default via the tidier for your model. My tidier function example available in the gallery: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html#wald-ci\n\n\nQ: Is there an option to compare multiple regression models within a single table?
