See https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/understanding-the-r-pipe/ for more details\n\n\nQ: What statistics can you use in tbl_summary(statistic=) argument? How does the function know \"{min}, {max}\" is the range?\n\n\nThere are a set of known names for default statistics that you can use in this function. These (plus glue syntax) allow you to display specific statistics. See more details here, under the statistic argument section: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_summary.html\n\n\nQ: How do you display mean instead of median?\n\n\nAdjust the statistic argument:\n\n\ntrial %>%\n  select(age) %>%\n  tbl_summary(statistic = everything() ~ \"{mean}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N = 2001\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n47\n        Unknown\n11\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Mean\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: With add_n() can you change the label to specify that it represents non-missing values?\n\n\nYes, you can change this with col_label argument:\n\n\ntrial |>\n  select(age, grade, trt) %>%\n  tbl_summary(\n    by = trt,\n    missing = \"no\"\n  ) |> \n  add_overall() |> \n  add_n(col_label = \"**N (Non-missing)**\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N (Non-missing)\n      Overall, N = 2001\n      Drug A, N = 981\n      Drug B, N = 1021\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n189\n47 (38, 57)\n46 (37, 59)\n48 (39, 56)\n    Grade\n200\n\n\n\n        I\n\n68 (34%)\n35 (36%)\n33 (32%)\n        II\n\n68 (34%)\n32 (33%)\n36 (35%)\n        III\n\n64 (32%)\n31 (32%)\n33 (32%)\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How can you remove the death variable inside the tbl_summary() function?\n\n\nUse adplyr::select() prior to tbl_summary or use the include = argument in tbl_summary().

Or use modify_table_styling() for new footnotes. https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/modify_table_styling.html\n\n\nQ: Does gtsummary support role selection like {recipes}?\n\n\nUse the selectors all_continuous(), all_categorical(), etc.\n\n\nQ: There is an error trying to use add_difference() with add_p()\n\n\nThis is because you are trying to add two p’s to same table. You could consider doing two separate tables then using tbl_merge() to merge them, but presenting these two p-values in one table could be confusing.\n\n\nQ: It would be great to have an “asterisk_p” to show significant p-values, like bold_p()\n\n\nadd_significance_stars() already exists! https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_significance_stars.html\n\n\nQ: If there are more than two groups, is there any function for post-hoc testing?\n\n\nHere are supported tests: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tests.html. Post-hoc tests might require custom testing. There are some relevant questions on stackoverflow.com that may be useful.\n\n\nQ: Can gtsummary give Bayesian statistics result?\n\n\nSee https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tests.html for supported tests. If it is not supported, you can use custom functions for p-values (see add_p()) or add_stat() to use a custom statistic.\n\n\nQ: The {rms} package fits are not supported?\n\n\nYou can file an issue for support. You can also use custom tidier. See Wald example in table gallery for tips on how to do this: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html#wald-ci\n\n\nQ: How does it handle interaction terms?\n\n\nGorgeously:\n\n\ntbl <-\n      lm(time ~ ph.ecog*sex, survival::lung) %>%\n      tbl_regression(label = list(ph.ecog = \"ECOG Score\", sex = \"Sex\"))\n    \ntbl\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    ECOG Score\n-119\n-233, -5.5\n0.040\n    Sex\n11\n-79, 102\n0.8\n    ECOG Score * Sex\n43\n-33, 120\n0.3\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What does exponentiate=TRUE do again in tbl_regression()? I missed it.\n\n\nExponentiation coefficients so you can easily report OR instead of log(OR) or HRs instead of raw coefficients.\n\n\nQ: Is there a way to add an additional footnote saying T1 is the control? The default dash may be interpreted as a “missing value”.\n\n\nmodify_table_styling() https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/modify_table_styling.html or use argument add_estimate_to_reference_rows = TRUE\n\n\nglm(death ~ age + grade, data = trial, family = binomial) %>%\n  tbl_regression( exponentiate = TRUE, add_estimate_to_reference_rows = FALSE ) %>%\n  add_global_p() %>%\n  modify_table_styling(columns = c(estimate, ci),\n                       rows = reference_row == TRUE, \n                       missing_symbol = \"Ref.\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      OR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n1.01\n0.99, 1.03\n0.3\n    Grade\n\n\n0.053\n        I\nRef.\nRef.\n\n        II\n1.11\n0.56, 2.24\n\n        III\n2.28\n1.11, 4.75\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use themes and change tbl_regression-str:ref_row_text option: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/themes.html\n\n\nQ: Can add_global_p() and the global p-value without removing the p-value for each level?\n\n\nThere is an arg in add_global_p() called keep; that will keep both p-values. It is FALSE by default\n\n\nglm(death ~ age + grade, data = trial, family = binomial) %>%\n  tbl_regression(exponentiate = TRUE,\n                 add_estimate_to_reference_rows = FALSE) %>%\n  add_global_p(keep = TRUE) \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      OR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Age\n1.01\n0.99, 1.03\n0.3\n    Grade\n\n\n0.053\n        I\n—\n—\n\n        II\n1.11\n0.56, 2.24\n0.8\n        III\n2.28\n1.11, 4.75\n0.025\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: tbl_regression(): Are the p-values per Wald by default?\n\n\nYou need to look at the details for your specific model and what the summary function returns. You can change default via the tidier for your model. My tidier function example available in the gallery: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html#wald-ci\n\n\nQ: Is there an option to compare multiple regression models within a single table? (e.g., when performing sensitivity analyses). I’m thinking of a situation where we are using different adjustment sets of covariates. I’m thinking of a situation where we are using different adjustment sets of covariates.\n\n\nUse tbl_merge()\n\n\nQ: Does it work with {tidymodels}?\n\n\nThere are currently some issues with dummy variables, but we are working on it for future release.\n\n\nQ: Can you have super/sub scripts in variable names\n\n\nUse utf8 characters and markdown characters. {gt} sometimes has some issues with “common markdown” language so be aware of your output type and print engine, but most likely they will work.\n\n\nQ: Is the marginal adjusted mean estimated using the median of the other covariates fitting the model?\n\n\nThis is calculated outside the package. See emmeans::emmeans() for details on calculations.\n\n\nQ: Does tbl_regression() support ridge/lasso regressions? I usually use {glmnet} for these\n\n\nNot currently supported but see https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary/issues/1280 for more details.\n\n\nQ: For sex, how do i get it to show the Male level instead of the Female reference group?\n\n\ninline_text() has a level= argument to select this.\n\n\nQ: If I change the CI to 90%, I need to update the pattern to 90% CI {ci} right?\n\n\nIf you are using the default pattern ({conf.level}), you don’t need to change anything, but if you hard code like 95%, then yes, use pattern = \"odds ratio {estimate}; {conf.level*100}% CI {ci}\"\n\n\nQ: Can I add LaTeX symbols in the inline text like chi square results?\n\n\nProbably?\n\n\nQ: Can add_glance_source_note(), give just adjusted R^2 ?\n\n\nYes!\n\n\nmod <- lm(age ~ marker + grade, trial) %>% tbl_regression()\nmod %>% \n  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared))\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Marker Level (ng/mL)\n-0.04\n-2.6, 2.5\n>0.9\n    Grade\n\n\n\n        I\n—\n—\n\n        II\n0.64\n-4.7, 6.0\n0.8\n        III\n2.4\n-2.8, 7.6\n0.4\n    R²\n0.005\n\n\n    Adjusted R²\n-0.012\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How can I increase the font size of a gtsummary object in a xaringan slide?\n\n\nYou can set a theme for this, or check out print engine options. See https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/rmarkdown.html\n\n\nQ: How do I decrease the height of the gtsummary table so it exports properly?\n\n\nDepends on print engine and desired output format.

It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques such as linear and non-linear modeling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, and clustering.\nR is one of the most used business analytics tools. For example, Facebook uses R for behavior analysis related to status updates and profile pictures. Google uses it to analyze advertising effectiveness and economic forecasting. Twitter leverages R for data visualization and semantic clustering. In the 2016 data science salary survey conducted by O’Reilly, R was ranked second in a category of programming languages for data science."

We are convinced that R is a powerful tool that can ultimately make your life easier by enabling efficient solutions to your data analytical problems. Also, R is completely free. Who doesn’t like that?\nThis course aims to facilitate the participant’s first steps in R and equip them with the tools and understanding to expand their technical know-how according to the needs of their specific research. It is neither a computer science nor a methodological course, but aimed at the practical needs of empirically working researchers.\nYou might think of R as an overly complicated status symbol for ambitious quantitative researchers. This is not quite true anymore as R has become much more user-friendly over the last years. Think of R is your friend and helper if you are interested in doing: insightful graphs, regression analysis, QCA, quantitative text analysis, web-scraping, data visualization, systematic hand-coding of documents, formal modelling, etc.\nWhile this course is most likely to attract people with solid statistical training who usually use Stata or SPSS, it can easily be attended by a broader audience. All you really need to know is [I] the structure of a typical dataset in the social sciences (rows are observations, columns are variables) and [II] the logic of dependent and independent variables.\nYou will learn how to use R to handle your data, describe it, analyse it (regressions), and transform it into beautiful graphs. At the end, you will have an idea of what R can do, and the resources to teach yourself more where needed."

It is difficult to decide which policy to accept orreject.\nSolution: By using the continuous credit report as input, we can create a model in R that will not only assess risk appetite but also make a predictive forecast as well.\n\n\n\nBanking\n\nProblem: Large amount of customer data is generated every day in Banks. While dealing with millions of customers on regular basis, it becomes hard to track their mortgages.\nSolution: R builds a custom model that maintains the loans provided to every individual customer which helps us to decide the amount to be paid by the customer over time."

    "section": "Features of R",
    "text": "Features of R\n\nR supports procedural programming with functions and object-oriented programming with generic functions. Procedural programming includes procedure, records, modules, and procedure calls. While object-oriented programming languageincludes class, objects, and functions.\nPackages are part of R programming. Hence, they are useful in collecting sets of R functions into a single unit.\nR is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\nR has an effective data handling and storage facility,\nR provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.\nR provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis. It provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.\nRs programming features include database input, exporting data, viewing data, variable labels, missing data, etc.\nR is an interpreted language. So we can access it through command line interpreter.\nR supports matrix arithmetic.\nR, SAS, and SPSS are three statistical languages. Of these three statistical languages, R is the only an open source."

    "text": "Comparison to other statistical programming software\n\nStata: The traditional choice of (academic) economists.\n\nStata is more specifically econometrics focused and is much more command-oriented. Easier to use for standard applications, but if there’s not a Stata command for what you want to do, it’s harder to write something yourself.\n\nStata is also very different than R in that you can only ever work with one dataset at a time, while in R, it’s typical to have a number of data objects in the environment.\n\nSAS: Similar to Stata, but more commonly used in business & the private sector, in part because it’s typically more convenient for massive datasets. Otherwise, I think it’s seen as a bit older and less user-friendly.\nPython: Another option based more on programming from scratch and with less prewritten commands. Python isn’t specific to math & statistics, but instead is a general programming language used across a range of fields.\nProbably the most similar software choice to R at this point, with better general use (and programming ease) at the cost of less package development specific to econometrics/data analysis.\nMatlab: Popular in macroeconomics and theory work, not so much in empirical work. Matlab is powerful, but is much more based on programming “from scratch” using matrices and mathematical expressions."
